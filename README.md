# FaceGuard (WIP)

Real-time facial verification system using OpenCV and DeepFace. Captures webcam input and compares it to a reference image, displaying live match results.

Uses the [Deepface](https://github.com/serengil/deepface) library.

Upcoming Goal: Add UI wrapper

## Usage
1. Place the reference images in the same directory as `main.py`, with the format `<username>_ref.jpg`.
2. Run `main.py`
3. Login with the appropriate username

## Next Steps
1. Model tuning and training (CNN Model)
